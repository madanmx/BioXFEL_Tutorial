# BioXFEL_Tutorial
This tutorial is intended to refine the light activated structure at 1ps.
Further, the refined structure will be evaluated to match with the observed (difference electron density) DED map and calculated DED map using the pearson correlation coefficent (pcc).
The data correspnds to the paper Elin et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53514

#Command to setup the github enviornement
